This paper presents the design, development, and control of a four Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) articulated manipulator utilizing a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) and an Arduino UNO microcontroller.

DenavitHartenberg (D-H) analysis was employed to model the forward and inverse kinematics of the manipulator. 

MATLAB was used to verify the end-effector position and compute the joint angles using the developed algorithms.

A user-friendly GUI was created in MATLAB to provide intuitive interaction with the manipulator, allowing users to adjust joint angles, visualize movements, and execute predefined tasks. 

The GUI communicated with the Arduino microcontroller, which controlled the servo motors attached to the manipulator joints.
